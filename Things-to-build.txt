# Data Structures to Build

## Linear Data Structures

### Arrays
- Dynamic Arrays (like ArrayList in Java or Vector in C++)

### Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List - Test Left
- Circular Linked List - Test left

### Stacks
- Array-based Stack
- Linked List-based Stack

### Queues
- Simple Queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out)
- Circular Queue
- Priority Queue (using a heap)
- Deque (Double-Ended Queue)

## Non-Linear Data Structures

### Trees

#### Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
- Standard BST - tests left

#### Self-Balancing BSTs
- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- Splay Tree

#### Heaps
- Min-Heap
- Max-Heap

#### B-Trees
- Standard B-Tree
- B+ Tree
- B* Tree

#### Tries (Prefix Trees)
- Standard Trie - search with ".", left
- Compressed Trie (Radix Tree)

### Graphs

#### Representations
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List

#### Types
- Directed Graph
- Undirected Graph
- Weighted Graph
- Unweighted Graph

### Hash-based Structures

#### Hash Tables / Hash Maps
- Implementation with separate chaining
- Implementation with open addressing (linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing)

#### Hash Sets

## Specialized and Abstract Data Structures

### Sets
- Sorted Sets (often implemented with balanced binary search trees)
- Unsorted Sets (often implemented with hash tables)

### Disjoint Set Union (DSU) / Union-Find
- Union by rank/size
- Path compression

### Graphs and Related Structures
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) - while this is an algorithm, the underlying structure and its variations (Prim's vs. Kruskal's) are often included as a data structure concept.

### Geometric Data Structures
- K-D Tree
- Quadtree / Octree

Tips:

🔹 Don’t just dump code — add clear documentation (README, usage examples, complexity analysis).

🔹 Include unit tests to show software engineering discipline.

🔹 Maybe add visualizations (e.g., graphs for trees, linked list diagrams) for extra polish.

🔹 Organize repo well (one folder per structure, with explanation).

🔹 Go beyond basics: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, hash maps… maybe even some advanced ones (tries, segment trees, bloom filters).

👉 If you want it to really shine for recruiters, frame it not just as “I implemented data structures”, but as “I built an educational library showcasing the implementation, usage, and performance of core data structures in Python.”
